A try to bruteforce I did a things 5000$ challenge of finding the right thing to do:

This is incomplete

## The puzzle
in his video [I regret making your horrible video ideas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf4GBKmU8Ww) at some timestamp there was a piece of paper lying on the floor: ``_ _ _ _ _  _ _  _  _ _ _ _ _``

It was obvious that throughout the video there was a stuffed duck sitting on or close to 13/14 things (unlcear whether to include the last szene or not)

In the end it was very unclear which duck meant which letter.

This script tries to solve for all possibilites using the scrabble wordlist.

Furtheremore we got the tip that it isn't ``Email me a screw``, and that 2 of 4 words were right, and that its only one a.

Solution was:
``Email me I smell``
